# GitHub Portfolio

I've created this repository to hold my portfolio website files while I get back up to speed with using GitHub!

My portfolio currently consists of a static website built using a CSS flex layout and some basic jQuery. I am in the process of creating a contact form that will send me emails using Amazon Simple Email Service. I've tested this locally and am just trying to wrap my brain around the best way to deploy the Java files.

Additionally, I've created a workflow that will drop all relevant files in this repository into my Amazon S3 bucket when I git push.

I'll be using this repositories for my ongoing experiments with API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and potentially CloudFront or Amplify (not sure which direction I'm headed here yet).
